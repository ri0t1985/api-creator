## Minimal Viable Product

* ☒ API: retun static data
* ☒ parsing data from HTML
* ☒ make selectors dynamic: 
  * ☒ create an API-endpoint to store new endpoints for an application
  * ☒ get rid of hardcoded endpoints

* Visually select HTML-element from target-website which contains relevant data

## Minimal Viable Learning 

* ☒ The coding-process
* ☒ Pair/peer-programming
* ☒ Understanding why doing decisions are made
* ☒ How to debug an API
* ☐ Kanban + / tasks / 
* ☐ scrum
* ☐ Agile - user stories with ...
* ☐ Sync front- and back-end
* ☒ IT-landscape
* ☒ understanding versioncontrol: github/gitlab/etc.

* ☒ mentoring / coaching
* ☒ pairprogramming
* ☒ setup an API from scratch
* ☒ gain further insights to develop an API from a website
