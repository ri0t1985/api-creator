* ☐ dynamic url: using the real websource instead of saved website-page

## Milestones

☒ API with 1 endpoint which provides hardcoded data
☒ Scrape data from website into storage
* Visually select HTML-element from target-website which contains relevant data

## Minimal Viable Learning 

* ☐ The coding-process
* ☐ Pair/peer-programming
* ☐ Understanding why doing decisions are made
* ☐ How to debug an API
* ☐ Kanban + / tasks / 
* ☐ scrum
* ☐ Agile - user stories with ...
* ☐ Sync front- and back-end
* ☐ IT-landscape
* ☐ understanding versioncontrol: github/gitlab/etc.

* ☐ mentoring / coaching
* ☐ pairprogramming
* ☐ setup an API from scratch
